# A Window Into Quality: Using Data Science to Predict Wine Quality

## Abstract
The Metis family is looking to start a new winery in the USA. They plan to do something a little different cultivate the Sezão grape from the Vinho Verde Wine Region in Northern Portugal as their red wine verietal. This partucular grape isn't grown much outside of Portugal and very little in the USA. With the Metis family being less familar with the Sezão grape and never having grown it they are looking for a way to know the potential wine quality throught the wine making process.

## Design
- **Business Problem**: How can we accurately forecast wine quality throughout production?

- **Impact**: Being able to accurately forecast a wines quality throughout the wine making process will lead to a better final product, enable accurate pricing of said wine, and help to improve production/ growing methods.

- **Main Constraints**: Getting the vineyard up and running. Will take time before vines are ready for wine production unless they have been previously planted. A wine lab will also be needed at the winery to test the wine samples.

- **Solutions**: Get accurate analysis of the wine throughout production and aging to know potential quality, make changes to the wine if needed, and final analysis when wine is ready for bottling for final quality check.

- **Technical Process**: Model will be run at each step during the wine making process once fermentation has started.

- **How to Validate Approach**: Run the model on other similar wines produced in the region.

- **Timeline**: Analysis and modeling will happen over the course of the first year of production.

- **Defined Success**: Using a 10 point quality scale we are able to access a minimum 5 quality wine using the model and use subsequent modeling to help improve quality.


## Data
The data used is from Kaggel, ["Prediction of quality of Wine"](https://www.kaggle.com/vishalyo990/prediction-of-quality-of-wine/notebook). The dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 

1600 rows/ 12 columns

Features used are typically tested for in wine production.
