# Question/ Need:
My client is looking to start a new winery in the USA. They plan to do something a little different and plat the Sezão grape from the Vinho Verde Wine Region in Northern Portugal.
This partucular grape isn't grown much outside of Portugal and very little in the USA. With my clients being less familar with the Sezão grape and never havng grown it they 
are looking for a way to know the potential quality of their wine once it is done fermenting and ready for ageing.

Once the quality has been deternined they can use that data to price the wine, and refine growing practices/ processing techniques at the vinyard.


# Data Description:
The data I will be using is from Kaggel, "Prediction of quality of Wine". The dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 1600 rows/ 12 columns

# Tools:
I am planning to use Tableau and Excel for EDA, and Python for modeling if needed.

# MVP Goal:
Do basic EDA and show rudamentary plots of the data to gain insite.
